# Phishing-email-detection
This project uses a fine-tuned `DistilBERT` model from HuggingFace Transformers to classify emails as either Phishing or Safe. The model is trained on labeled email text and provides robust predictions using modern NLP techniques.

## üîç Project Overview

With the rise in phishing attacks, identifying malicious emails is more critical than ever. This project leverages **transformer-based NLP** to automatically detect phishing content in emails using supervised learning.
